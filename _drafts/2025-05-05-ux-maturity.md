Largely because of Nielsen Norman Group's [2006 article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-stages-1-4-original/), the term _UX maturity_ has long since been used to describe where a company sits along a spectrum. 

_UX maturity_ has been re-articulated over the years, but the core idea has remained the same: there's this universal progression that companies undergo when they become enlightened about UX. Once they see the light, a company will go from undervaluing UX to seeing and promoting the value of UX, and as this happens, they predictably create UX departments and hire UX leaders.

The more formalized the UX department is, the more UX maturity the company is said to have. 

**I find it odd that this definition is mainly tied to UX staffing and internal organizational behaviors rather than being tied to outcomes that directly affect users and their experiences.**

One problem with the maturity metaphor is that it falls apart during hard times. Often, when there's an economic recession or a tech bubble, we see a corresponding recession in so-called UX maturity. The backsliding occurs precisely in the areas that are discussed in the various "UX maturity" articles online. There is a divestment of the formal UX department and the formal UX activities. Companies often do this out of economic necessity. They might not be able to afford to prioritize UX efforts when times are tight.

This is where the "maturity" metaphor breaks down.

Real maturity (in life) is something that sticks with you for the rest of your life. When a person has achieved maturity, they remain mature.

Maturity in life comes with an understanding of the world and what it means to make good decisions. It involves having internalized guiding principles that serve you no matter the circumstance. Hardships (such as an economic recession) only serve to highlight the presence of maturity. Hardships don't make real maturity recede or disappear.

“Maturity” appears to be the wrong metaphor. I might instead call it _UX Investment_. That’s what we’re really talking about. Investment can ebb and flow over time, based on how much you can afford to invest. And that's okay. That's just how the world works.
