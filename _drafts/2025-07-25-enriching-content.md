Lately, I've come to the realization that certain content is essentially "empty calories" - junk content - while other content is informationally nutritious. I'm realizing this appears to be a property of the content itself. 

I'm seeking to welcome in the enriching kind of content and do away with the junk content. Cleaning up my info diet, so to speak.

Here are some categories I particularly care about alongside specific low-cost channels: 

* Art, Culture & History
	* [Ken Burns](https://www.pbs.org/franchise/ken-burns/)
	* [Rick Steves' Europe](https://www.ricksteves.com/)
* Books
	* [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/)
* Classical Music
	* [ClassicCat.net](https://www.classiccat.net/)
	* [WFMT Classical](https://www.wfmt.com/listen)
* Folk Music
	* [Folk Alley](https://folkalley.com/)
* Science 
	* [Huberman Lab](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/huberman-lab/id1545953110)
	* [Nature](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/)
	* [NOVA](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/)
* Storytelling
	* [Levar Burton Reads](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/levar-burton-reads/id1244649384)
	* [Prairie Home Companion](https://www.prairiehome.org/)

There's this funny thought that often comes up: 

> _We've got access to all the world's information at our fingertips. We could read the words of Aristotle and Marcus Aurelius. And yet, all we do is scroll through memes and watch cat videos._

Well, what if you actually accessed the world's rich information!
