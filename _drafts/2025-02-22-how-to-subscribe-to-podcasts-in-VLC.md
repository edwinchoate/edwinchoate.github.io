This brief posts describes how to subscribe to podcasts in your VLC media player. 

(If you don't have VLC installed already, you can get it from [videolan.org/vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).)

## Step 1. Find the Apple podcast link 

The fastest way to do this is Google search "<<name of podcast>> Apple Podcasts", and then right-click > Copy URL. 

Or, if you'd prefer to open the page, you can open the Apple Podcast page for the podcast and copy the link from the browser URL bar. 

The URL you want should take the format: `https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/name-of-podcast/id1234567890`.

## Step 2. Convert the Apple link to the raw RSS link

The podcatcher _Podcast Addict_ hosts a helpful utility page for doing just this. 

Go to [getrssfeed.com](https://getrssfeed.com/).

Paste the Apple podcast link into the main text field on the page and click the _Find RSS Feed_ button. 

Click the _Copy URL_ button to put the raw RSS link on your clipboard.

## Step 3. Add the podcast to VLC

In VLC, the podcasts are on the left-hand nav (_Podcasts_ section). 

Click the plus button next to the _Podcasts_ menu item. 

In the dialog that pops up, paste the RSS link you got from getrssfeed.com. 

## Step 4. Test an episode

Once you add the podcast, it should appear in the left nav. Open the podcast and launch an episode to make sure it's working. (Generally, if one episode works, the whole feed should work fine.) 

Happy podcasting!
