## The Goal

This project was just for fun and for learning purposes. The idea of this project was to go from an idea to a published app on the app store and do every step in between myself from scratch. **I wanted to mount the learning curve of bumping into all of the unexpected things I'd encounter along the way**. To accelerate this project, I gave myself a constraint: I must create literally the simplest app that I can think of, AND the app must be an actual complete tool that could actually be useful for something.

Note: I did not use any AI tools during this project (because the point of this project was to learn by doing these things myself).

After brainstorming, I decided a tally counter app met my criteria. 

## What's a Tally Counter?

A tally counter is a simple device that solves a simple problem: you might forget and "lose your place" when you're trying to count something. It's a way of getting a number out of your head and into the world.

    <figcaption>Back in the olden days before mass survelliance, if an organization wanted to sum up the total attendance at some big event (like a football game), there'd be a guy sitting by the entrance holding one of these. Each time a person would enter the venue, he'd press a button that would increment the total by one. At the end of the night, you'd have the total attendance of the event.</figcaption>

## Designing the App

I decided it would make the UX designer in me happy if there was a skeuomorphic metaphor in the app's interface design so I decided to make it look like the physical tally counter devices of the days of old (as pictured above). I felt even better about that when I searched the app stores and saw that no one had really made this design yet. (There are, however, a gazillion tally counter apps on the app stores at this point. This is by no means an original idea, but that is not the point of this project.)

    <img alt="a digital vector of a tally counter numeric display side by side next to a physical one showing that they visuals are similar" src="/assets/img/tally-counter/number-display-inspiration.png" />
    <figcaption>I designed a vector graphic of the numeric display in Figma, basing the visuals and the font on the look and feel of the physical device.</figcaption>

Was this necessary? Of course not, but I wanted to learn how to take a custom vector graphic, design it, and put it into the code. I also learned how to place font (text) into the graphic which would need to be updated as the user interacted with the app.
