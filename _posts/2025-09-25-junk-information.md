I might define _**junk food**_ as something that seems like a natural food but has been modified in such a way that makes it taste a little too good, ultimately leading to health problems if consumed in large quantities. Therein lies the essence of junk: things that ultimately aren't good for us. 

We know that we're seeing a rise in mental health problems. The question is... what's causing them? I'm not prepared to truly answer that question because I believe there's still lots of research to do to before we figure that out. One intuition I have developed, however, is that **junk information exists** and **it impacts us regularly**. 

We have an intuitive sense of what happens to us if we consume too much junk food, but what about junk _information_? Are there really negative consequences if we consume certain information? If there are, what are they? I suspect that - just like with junk food - if you consume too much junk information, your health will suffer.

Perhaps a definition for _**junk information**_ would be: content that seems informative or enriching but has been created in such a way that makes it grab a little too much of your attention, ultimately leading to health problems if consumed in large quantities.

The constructive thing about this line of thinking is that it makes the path forward clearer.

We need to:

1. Learn how to separate the _nutritious information_ from the _junk information_, and
2. Fill the majority of our information diets with the nutritious kind

Some amount of junk information will be okay, as long as it's held to an appropriate limit.

I imagine in the future, we'll all become much savvier in how we approach the information diet. As the saying goes, _you are what you eat_. Maybe it's also true that you are what you read.
